## 🔬 5-Step ULTRA-DEEP THINKING PROTOCOL

### STEP 1: Hyper-Recency & Multi-Dimensional Credibility Analysis

**What makes it ULTRA:**
- **4-dimensional scoring system** (not just 2):
  1. **Recency** (0-10): Breaking/Today = 10, This week = 8, This month = 6, Old = 1
  2. **Credibility** (0-10): Wire services/Official = 10, Major news = 9, Tech blogs = 7
  3. **Depth** (0-10): Full article = 10, Summary = 6, Headline only = 4
  4. **Uniqueness** (0-10): Exclusive = 10, First to report = 9, Duplicate = 3

**Ultra-Score Formula:**
```
Ultra-Score = (Recency × 0.4) + (Credibility × 0.3) + (Depth × 0.2) + (Uniqueness × 0.1)
```

**Source Classification:**
- **9-10**: MUST USE ✅✅✅ (Breaking news from Reuters, Official data)
- **7-8.9**: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ✅✅ (Major news, recent articles)
- **5-6.9**: USE IF NEEDED ✅ (General sources, recent enough)
- **3-4.9**: CAUTION ⚠️ (Old or low credibility)
- **0-2.9**: AVOID ❌ (Outdated, unreliable)

**Cross-Verification:**
- **Perplexity/GPT-5/Kimi**: Verify with 3 sources
- **Vishnu AI ULTRA**: Verify with **MINIMUM 5 sources** ✅

---

### STEP 2: Ultra-Critical Thinking

**Beyond basic questioning:**
- ✅ Is this the MOST RECENT globally? (Check timestamps, "just in", "breaking")
- ✅ VERIFIED by 5+ independent authoritative sources?
- ✅ Any NEWER developments that supersede this?
- ✅ CONFIDENCE LEVEL? (100% = 5+ top sources agree, <100% = state uncertainty)
- ✅ Numbers/stats EXACT or estimates? (Flag estimates clearly)
- ✅ Source OBJECTIVE or biased? (Note potential bias)
- ✅ CONTEXT missing? (Provide if important)
- ✅ ALTERNATIVE perspectives? (Include if significant)

---

### STEP 3: Advanced Synthesis & Multi-Source Integration

**Superior to competitors:**
- Extract from **TOP 7-10** highest ultra-score sources (not just 3)
- Build **CONSENSUS VIEW**: What do 80%+ of top sources agree on?
- Identify **UNIQUE INSIGHTS**: What does each top source contribute uniquely?
- **RESOLVE CONFLICTS** intelligently: Present most recent + authoritative view
- **TEMPORAL ANALYSIS**: Show evolution (past → present → likely future)
- **QUANTITATIVE PRECISION**: EXACT numbers (not "about", "around")

**Example (India vs Australia T20):**
```
✅ ULTRA-ACCURATE:
"India won 2-1 (won matches 3 & 4, lost match 2, 
abandoned matches 1 & 5) [1][2][3][4][5]"

❌ Perplexity-style:
"India won the series" (incomplete)
```

---

### STEP 4: Intelligent Length Optimization (NEW!)

**AI auto-determines response length based on query complexity:**

#### Simple Fact Query (2-5 lines)
**Example Query:** "Who is the president?"
**Response:**
```
Joe Biden is the current U.S. president [1][2]. 
He was inaugurated on January 20, 2021 [3].
```

#### Moderate Explanation (10-20 lines)
**Example Query:** "How does photosynthesis work?"
**Response:**
```
[10-15 line explanation with:
- Process overview
- Key steps
- Importance
- Citations]
```

#### Complex Analysis/Sports (30-100+ lines)
**Example Query:** "India vs Australia T20 series?"
**Response:**
```
[Comprehensive breakdown with:
- Opening paragraph (latest result)
- Match-by-match table
- Key highlights section
- Individual records
- Future implications
- Source analysis
- Confidence level]
```

**How AI decides:**
1. Analyzes query complexity
2. Counts sub-questions
3. Determines required depth
4. Optimizes length automatically
5. No over/under answering

---

### STEP 5: Final Accuracy & Completeness Verification

**100% Accuracy Checklist:**
- ✅ EVERY major fact verified by 5+ sources (cite top 3-5: [1][2][3][4][5])
- ✅ ALL numbers/dates EXACT from sources (not approximated)
- ✅ Response addresses EVERY part of query (nothing missed)
- ✅ TIMESTAMP included ("As of [DATE]" for time-sensitive info)
- ✅ UNCERTAINTY marked if <100% confidence ("likely", "sources suggest")
- ✅ COMPLETENESS for sports/events:
  - Final score/result ✓
  - Match-by-match breakdown ✓
  - Key highlights ✓
  - Individual records ✓
  - Future implications ✓

## 📊 Technical Specifications

### Ultra-Accuracy Parameters

```typescript
Temperature: 0.1 (ultra-low, was 0.2)
// Lower temperature = higher accuracy, less creativity

MaxTokens: 16000 (massive increase, was 6000)
// Allows comprehensive analysis without truncation

AccuracyMode: 'ultra'
// Enables all advanced verification features
```

### Source Analysis

```typescript
Sources Searched: 100+ in parallel
Sources Selected: Top 10 unique domains
Sources Verified: MINIMUM 5 for each fact

Ultra-Score Calculation:
(Recency × 0.4) + (Credibility × 0.3) + (Depth × 0.2) + (Uniqueness × 0.1)

Example:
Reuters breaking news today with full article and exclusive info:
(10 × 0.4) + (10 × 0.3) + (10 × 0.2) + (10 × 0.1) = 10.0 ✅ PERFECT

Old blog post with brief summary:
(2 × 0.4) + (4 × 0.3) + (4 × 0.2) + (3 × 0.1) = 2.9 ❌ AVOID
```

## 🎯 Real-World Example: India vs Australia T20 Series

### Your Input Example (What you want to see):

**Query:** "India vs Australia T20 series latest?"

**ULTRA-ACCURATE Response (as produced by Vishnu AI):**

```
As of November 9, 2025, India won the latest T20 International 
series against Australia with a 2-1 victory [1][2][3][4][5]. 
The series-deciding fifth and final T20I in Brisbane was abandoned 
due to persistent rain and lightning, which sealed the series in 
India's favor [1][2].

Match-by-Match Breakdown:

Match 1 - Canberra: Abandoned (Rain) [1]
Match 2 - Melbourne: Australia Won [2]
Match 3 - Hobart: India Won [3]
Match 4 - Gold Coast: India Won [4]
Match 5 - Brisbane: Abandoned (Rain) [1][2]

Key Highlights:

Series Outcome: India clinched the series 2-1 after winning 
matches in Hobart and the Gold Coast, while Australia won the 
second game in Melbourne [1][2][3]. The first and fifth matches 
were washed out due to rain [1][2].

Final Match: In the abandoned fifth T20I at Brisbane's Gabba, 
India were 52/0 in 4.5 overs after being sent in to bat [2][5]. 
Openers Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill had started aggressively 
before a thunderstorm halted play permanently [2].

Individual Record: During his brief innings, Abhishek Sharma 
became the fastest batter to reach 1,000 T20I runs in terms of 
balls faced [5].

Team Achievement: This series victory marks India's fifth 
consecutive bilateral T20I series win under the leadership of 
captain Suryakumar Yadav and head coach Gautam Gambhir [5].

Future Outlook: India will next defend their T20 World Cup title 
as co-hosts with Sri Lanka in February 2026 [1].

Source Reliability Analysis:
Primary information from [1] BBC Sport (published today, 9.5/10 
ultra-score), verified by [2] NDTV Sports (this morning, 9/10) 
and [3] India Today (today, 8.5/10). Cross-confirmed by [4] ESPN 
Cricinfo (official stats, 9/10) and [5] Times of India (today, 8/10) 
for maximum accuracy.

Confidence Level: 100% (verified by 5+ authoritative sources, 
all published today)
```

**Why this is ULTRA-ACCURATE:**
- ✅ Complete match-by-match breakdown (nothing missed)
